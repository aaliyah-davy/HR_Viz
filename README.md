# Portfolio

I am a published Duke Grad with a background in genetics and genomics, including but not limited to data collection, data analysis, hypothesis testing, heuristics intuition, and more. I'm a team-player who enjoys collaborating with others to develop tools of great impact and value.

My projects are centered around creating feedback for businesses in different stages of development: Analysing customer feedback, Predicting monthly sales, Detecting potential security risks, Visualizing employee attrition.
_Software: Python, SQL, Javascript, HTML_

- Sales Time Series Forecasting
  - Interviewed local business owners on preferred resource management tools; identified potential market gaps in  machine learning tools for chains and small businesses  
  - Created 97% accurate multivariate time series forecasting model that predicts retail sales for the next 6 months based on passed 5 years of store sales  
_Tools: Python, Scikit-Learn, Keras, Pandas, TensorFlow_
- AWS Customer Feedback Sentiment Analysis
  - Trained 94% accurate multi-class sentiment classifier, analyzing over 3 million product reviews with automated  model optimization and containerization using best practices in AWS  
  - Implemented agile methods to ease CI/CD of customer relationship management solutions 
_Tools: Python, Docker, SageMaker, S3, EC, Keras Backend_
- Real-Time Danger Detection
  - Designed and deployed 90% accurate browser-based object recognition and classification algorithm that recognizes fights, anger, and weapons in real-time via webcam 
  - Cross-referenced real security footage for data augmentation to generate training examples that reflect reality like  changes in times of day, positions of subject/object, and camera quality
